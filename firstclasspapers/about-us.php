        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="cont">
          <p>All of the writers we hire here at First Class Papers are academic virtuosos who have received high praise and laudatory feedback from professors/teachers along their respective journeys. We make it a prerequisite that all of our writers are, at the very least, at the Bachelor's degree level and have attained at least a 3.7 cumulative GPA. The bulk of the writers within our ranks are MA/MS or PhD degree holders in a variety of subject areas including Mathematics, Computer Science, Social and Natural Sciences, Law, Management, Business Administration, etc. To become part of our organization, applicants must meet stringent requirements. First of all, they must have extensive knowledge within their respective fields and must submit an academic portfolio that includes much of their past work. We do not attempt to expedite the application process in any way, because we want to ensure that we only associate with the best of the best, We in turn pass this quality onto you, the customer.</p>
          <p>We strive to have a diverse group of individuals on our team, but in order to write for us, you must come from an English-speaking country. This is a broad criterion, considering that English is so widely spoken throughout the world, but it works to our advantage; having people spread out through different geographical locations and time zones enables us to be available around the clock. For example, if it is 3am for you, and you desperately need a paper by sunrise, we will have a writer in a location where it is 3pm working diligently to get your order out to you..</p>
          <p>As aforementioned, we hold ourselves to the highest standards. We implement a multi-phase hiring process aimed at weeding out subpar writers and discovering true talent. All applicants (there are no exceptions) must complete a lengthy test on grammatical conventions, spelling, sentence structure, citation styles, vocabulary, etc., provide their "academic portfolios," send their resume, qualifications, and/or curriculum vitae, write a sample essay within a given time period, and fill out a comprehensive registration form. This is all in an effort to provide you with what you deserve: quality and professionalism.</p>
